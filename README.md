[![Build ZMK firmware](https://github.com/3top1a/modelk-zmk/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/3top1a/modelk-zmk/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Some feedback on the docs (might make PRs):
- Add a file structure page
- Device tree/kconfig all vars page
- folders are files also????
- Status LEDs?
